# View-MCGalaxy-lvl

A python code that reads and views .lvl MCGalaxy level format.

I added a fog but it still renders very slow

drop any .lvl file and enter it when you ran python code.

Before running code check/install all of this libraries:

```
pip install ursina
pip install gzip
pip install struct
```
I'll add later all classic block support.

Enjoy!
